Those of you who haven't had the fortune of gracing the island of Ireland with your presence, I present below the best two dimensional representation of Ireland that I have to offer. Enjoy!

"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, 
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made; 
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee, 
And live alone in the bee-loud glade."
