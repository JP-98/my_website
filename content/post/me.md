Dia dhaoibh! 

John Purcell is ainm dom. Is as an Éire dom (dar ndóigh!), ach táim i mo chónaí sa tír gan anam: an Sasana, leis na chótaí dearga! Ceapaim nach bhfuil clú dá laghad agat cad atá a rá agam; mar sin, leanfaidh mé le mo scéal i mBéarla.

I hope you enjoyed some of my native tongue, but I would prefer to hear your intuitive guess at the pronunciation. Anyways, my name is John Purcell, and I hail from the land of Saints and Scholars: Ireland. 

I grew up on a farm in rural Ireland, with space for miles around and only sounds of wind caressing the long grass in summer and the waning trees in winter. Feel free to enjoy the aesthetics of my childhood stomping ground below.

Though I love where I'm from, my other passions have brought me elsewhere, and have clearly have brought you to me also! I enjoy travelling, playing music, and most importantly, debt. My professional interests encompass debt capital markets, private credit, securitised debt investing, multi-asset investing, and portfolio optimisation.

My academic experiences have led me through the shallow end of the programming pool thus far, and I have shared some of my work in Python and Julia. Please feel free to send mark-ups as most of it is built for function as opposed to aesthetics for the purists amongst the audience.

Anyways, please feel free to reach out whenever, contact details are listed in the footer.

John.
